  desc: Hi, i'm Bob. Welcome to my website! After having Â± two years of experience as a Data Scientist I have started doing personal projects next to my work. I use this website to showcase these projects. Next to programming I like travelling & being outdoors, video- & boardgames, fantasy novels, series & films, bad puns and even worse puns. # Describe yourself.
